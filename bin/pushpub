# Array called pubrepo
# If you have more than one repository you want to push to, 
# in a new file, you can add it in there and the script will push it.
# This is suggested so that this one doesn't get committed with your changes,
# and then have everyone who uses this script trying to push to your
# repositories.
#
# syntax is sftp://site.domain/directory/repo \
# for repository server machines that don't have bzr installed on it.
